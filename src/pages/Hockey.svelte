    <h1>Compounding Returns with High Probability Hockey Outcomes</h1>

    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>This page outlines a personal strategy I developed to gamble on the NHL. While I hope that this page can be helpful to its readers, I also must stress the importance of responsible gambling. Gambling carries a serious risk, so use your money responsibly and keep yourself informed before placing bets.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>I like to bet on sports. I like investing. What do these things have in common? If you make smart choices, you can make money by barely lifting a finger. If you're stupid (or sometimes unlucky) then money can vanish in an instant. Sometimes I focus too much on the first part and forget about the second part.</p>
    <p>Investing in a good diversified ETF can generally produce annual returns of at least 7%. This is nice, but a year is a long time to wait, and the best of your returns won't come until you're super old.</p>
    <p>Investing is great because of the compounding effects down the road, that $1 today could be generating 100s or thousands of dollars in 50 years time depending on how it was invested. Again, I'm too impatient to wait years for compounding. What if we could compound daily?</p>

    <h1>Corollary</h1>
    <p>Sportsbooks want you to bet on low-probability outcomes, and you're drawn toward low-probability outcomes because of the high payouts. However, whenever you bet on the total or the spread that are advertised on the main page of an online sportsbook, you're often shown the outcomes that the book predict at 50-50 chances of happening. Some people may feel comfortable in a coin flip, but we can do better.</p>
    <p>High probability outcomes have lower payouts, but those low payouts still trounce an average day for any fund in the stock market.</p>
    <p>So, here we have it. Betting on high probability outcomes in sports with low payouts on a daily basis with a high success rate will run laps around parking money in an investment fund. However, lost bets will spell greater and harder to recover from losses than if the market takes a dip.</p>
    <p>There is a massive difference between depreciating assets and lost bets. One could reappreciate value. The other is gone for good. Bear that in mind always.</p>

    <h1>The Main Strategy</h1>
    <p>This strategy revolves around professional Hockey because of two reasons. First, the NHL plays every night from mid October to mid April. That's half a year, or approximately 180 compounding periods - about 2 lifetimes in years. The second reason is that NHL outcomes fall in a relatively tight band compared to the NBA, MLB or NFL. This makes it easy to make broad, generalized statements about outcomes that are highly likely to come true.</p>
    <p>There are 2 primary bets and 1 secondary bet in this strategy. The two primary bets are Both Teams to Score (BTTS) and Under 9.5 (U9.5). BTTS simply requires both teams to score a single goal in regulation time. U9.5 requires fewer than 10 goals to be scored in the entire game.</p>
    <p>These two bets have great synergy because in any given NHL game, at least one is almost guaranteed to happen. The only way neither happens is if one team wins 10-0 or greater, which is insanely rare. The last time it happened was in 2016. If more than 9 goals are scored, it's highly probable that both teams scored. If one team was shut out, it's very unlikely that the other scored 10 or more.</p>
    <p>BTTS I've generally seen with American odds between -800 (12% profit) and -2000 (5% profit), with the vast majority falling between -1200 (8% profit) and -1600 (6% profit). U9.5 has gone as high as -1800 (5.5%) and -3000 (3.3%). With smart choices and good fortune in this strategy, 5-7% daily returns are possible.</p>
    <p>Earlier a third, secondary bet was mentioned. That bet is for a category offered by some books called "Race to 5 goals", and the choice that you should make, should you have the information to make you feel confident in it, is "Neither". I call this bet "BTU5" for "Both Teams Under 5". If the game ends 4-4 and a 5th goal is scored in overtime, the bet still wins. This bet I've seen offered between -300 and -500 odds. It's payout is much better but it's probability is much lower. Use this pick sparingly.</p>
    <p>So, on a nightly basis someone who wants to try this strategy should take their allocated amount of money, and bet it all - or almost all of it - on the hockey games that night. the number of games varies nightly, from as many as 13 to as few as 2. I advise to never split more than 6 ways, because more picks means higher chances of getting one wrong. This strategy is based on high probability, not guaranteed probability. Risking all, or almost all of your purse is how compounding can take effect. The effects will be weaker if only 50% is wagered daily, as an example. Do not parlay your picks. That's just asking for trouble.</p>
    <p>It's important to stick with your gut in this strategy. Don't change your bet because it's unavailable (this may happen often, especially with alternate totals like U9.5). If it's not available, don't bet. pick a different game. Track your pick and see if you were right. If you were, you'll get it next time it's available.</p>
