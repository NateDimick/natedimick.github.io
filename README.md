# This is the Source Code of my Personal Website

[natedmick.com](https://natedimick.com) is one part portfolio site, one part experimental playground. For me, it's a place to hone frontend skills. For the rest of the world, it's a place to learn about me and what I've done.

This site has a custom github action that performs npm build to compile the svelte files, then only serves the public directory.
