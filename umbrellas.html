            <h1>I Hate Umbrellas</h1>
            <h2>This page stands as my umbrella manifesto, the strongest opinion that I have on any subject matter</h2>

            <h1>The Umbrella Manifesto</h1>
            <h2>Part 1: Raincoat Superiority</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Raincoats are superior to umbrellas and this fact in inarguable</li>
                <li>Raincoats provide quick and stylish rain protection</li>
                <li>Raincoats leave the hands free, making it easier to carry objects, open doors, and catch yourself should you fall</li>
                <li>Raincoats come in many fun colors and include pockets</li>
                <li>Raincoats can compress to very small sizes, making them easy to throw in a backpack for unexpected weather</li>
                <li>Raincoats often act as windbreakers, and their performance is not reduced or compromised in heavy winds</li>
                <li>Raincoats do not interfere with the personal space of others</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Part 2: Umbrella Inferiority</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Umbrellas are cumbersome and ugly</li>
                <li>Umbrellas require 1 hand to hold and often both hands to fully operate</li>
                <li>Umbrella users often congest entryways whilst struggling to expand or contract their terrible device</li>
                <li>Short people carrying umbrellas are often unaware of how their umbrella expand their own personal footprint, endangering taller passers by who risk being poked in the eye by the small nubs around the circumference of the umbrella </li>
                <li>Umbrellas are prone to over extend in the wind, rendering them useless and broken</li>
                <li>People who leave their umbrellas expanded upside down indoors are the worst for their inconsideration of public indoor space</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Part 3: Counterpoints to Points Made in Favor of Umbrellas</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Point</strong> "Umbrellas are easier to use"</p>
                    <p><strong>Counterpoint</strong> If you can dress yourself, you can wear a raincoat</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Point</strong> "If it's windy, raincoats don't protect your legs"</p>
                    <p><strong>Counterpoint</strong> Neither will your umbrella</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Point</strong> "You can share an umbrella with someone else"</p>
                    <p><strong>Counterpoint</strong> Have you ever tried that? How difficult and clumsy it is? Personal umbrellas are too large for one person but too small for 2. Large umbrellas are way too large. Plus, it's not your fault that your friend didn't check the weather forecast and pack accordingly</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Part 4: So What If I Use an Umbrella?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>That's fine, you do you</li>
                <li>Clearly my arguments have not swayed you</li>
                <li>That's okay, but I think you're doing the wrong thing. A really stupid wrong thing.</li>
                <li>Next time it rains... think before going out</li>
                <li>And if the item you use to stay dry is really the best item for the job</li>
            </ol>
