# I wanted a website to call my own

But there I was, a college senior, CS major, and I had never touched a lick of html, css, javascript... none of it. Not sure if this was my fault or my university's fault but let's not throw stones. I was motivated and capable and so I used all the free resouces available to me to start putting together a bio/portfolio site.

This page has evolved a lot since then, and nowadays its less of a portfolio/bio and more of a place to experiment, host some helpful files and other things, and most importantly make sure the domain name I paid for goes to good use. I'm not really selling myself right now, so it can act as more of a pure representation of myself.

So here it is.

Imagine how blown away I was when I learned Github can host static websites FOR FREE! That's my favorite price! What a steal.

So if you're reading this readme you might as well go to the site and look at it... [click to visit](natedimick.github.io)
